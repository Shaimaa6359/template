        Reason: JavaScript executes in sequence (top to bottom). 
        In Code One, the script tries to access the <h1> element before it is created in the DOM. 
        Since the element with id="el" does not exist yet, the style change will fail.

      /*
      This code works because it waits for the window to load completely before trying to access the <h1> element.
